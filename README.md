Smart Traffic SimulationSmart Traffic Simulation is a project that aims to model and simulate traffic flow in an urban environment, incorporating intelligent algorithms to optimize traffic signals and reduce congestion. This simulation provides a platform to test various traffic management strategies and visualize their impact in real-time.Table of ContentsFeaturesInstallationUsageConfigurationContributingLicenseAcknowledgementsFeaturesReal-time Traffic Simulation: Visualize vehicle movement and traffic light changes in a dynamic environment.Intelligent Traffic Light Control: Implements algorithms (e.g., adaptive, AI-driven) to manage traffic signals based on real-time traffic density.Congestion Analysis: Tools or metrics to identify and analyze traffic bottlenecks and congestion points.Customizable Scenarios: Ability to define different road networks, traffic volumes, and vehicle types.User Interface: (If applicable, mention if there's a GUI for interaction or visualization).Data Visualization: (If applicable, mention how data like wait times, flow rates are displayed).InstallationTo get a local copy of the simulation up and running, follow these simple steps.PrerequisitesPython 3.x (Specify exact version if necessary, e.g., Python 3.8+)(List any other major dependencies like pip, specific libraries, etc.)StepsClone the repository:git clone https://github.com/Paaaarth1909/smart-traffic-simulation.git
Navigate into the project directory:cd smart-traffic-simulation
Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:On Windows:.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:source venv/bin/activate
Install the required Python packages:pip install -r requirements.txt
(If requirements.txt is not present, list individual packages like pip install pygame numpy etc.)UsageOnce installed, you can run the simulation from your terminal.python main.py
# OR, if there's a specific entry point:
python src/simulation.py
Running a specific scenario: (If the project supports different scenarios or configurations via command-line arguments, explain them here).python main.py --scenario urban_grid
ConfigurationThe simulation can be configured through various parameters.Configuration Files: (If using JSON, YAML, or Python files for configuration).Check the config/ directory (or similar) for files like settings.json or traffic_params.py.You can modify these files to adjust:Road network layoutNumber of vehiclesTraffic light timingsSimulation speed(Add other relevant configurable parameters)In-code Parameters: (If parameters are hardcoded or set at the top of a script, mention that).ContributingContributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request.
